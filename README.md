# **What is a Queue System?**
A queue system refers to any system in which:  
1. **Entities (customers, data, requests, packets, etc.) enter a queue.**  
2. **One or more servers provide service to them.**  
3. **Some wait in line while others receive service immediately.**  

### **Examples of Queue Systems:**
- **Taxis and Passengers**: Passengers wait for taxis, and when a taxi arrives, they board.  
- **Call Centers**: People call a service center and wait for an available operator.  
- **Data Processing on Servers**: Requests are sent to a server and need to be processed.
